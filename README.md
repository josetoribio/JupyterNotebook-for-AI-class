# 🌸 Iris SVM Classifier & Visualization

This project demonstrates how to use **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for **Iris flower classification** and visualize decision boundaries using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.  
It focuses on the relationship between **petal width** and **petal length** to distinguish between the three Iris species.

## 📊 Overview

The **Iris dataset** is a classic dataset used in statistics and machine learning.  
In this project, we will:

- Visualize the distribution of Iris flower species.  
- Train a **Linear SVM** classifier using Scikit-learn.  
- Plot the **decision boundary** and **margins** of the separating hyperplane.  
- Test predictions for different flower measurements.
